Eminent is a plugin for Awesome that hides / shows tags depending on if they have clients associated with them or not.
The difference between this fork and its upstream component is that new tags are never created dynamically except if they are addressed with MOD+<tag number>.
This is useful if you don't want to reuse tag that are assiciated with specific clients when the client is not started.
